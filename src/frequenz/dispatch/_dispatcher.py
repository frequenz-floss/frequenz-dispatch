class Dispatcher:
    """A highlevel interface for the dispatch API.

    This class provides a highlevel interface to the dispatch API.
    It provides two receiver functions:

    * [Lifecycle events receiver][frequenz.dispatch.Dispatcher.new_lifecycle_events_receiver]:
        Receives an event whenever a dispatch is created, updated or deleted.
    * [Running status change
        receiver][frequenz.dispatch.Dispatcher.new_running_state_event_receiver]:
        Receives an event whenever the running status of a dispatch changes.
        The running status of a dispatch can change due to a variety of reasons,
        such as but not limited to the dispatch being started, stopped, modified
        or deleted or reaching its scheduled start or end time.

        Any change that could potentially require the consumer to start, stop or
        reconfigure itself will cause a message to be sent.

    Example: Processing running state change dispatches
        ```python
        import os
        from frequenz.dispatch import Dispatcher
        from unittest.mock import MagicMock

        async def run():
            url = os.getenv("DISPATCH_API_URL", "grpc://fz-0004.frequenz.io:50051")
            key  = os.getenv("DISPATCH_API_KEY", "some-key")

            microgrid_id = 1

            dispatcher = Dispatcher(
                microgrid_id=microgrid_id,
                server_url=url,
                key=key
            )
            await dispatcher.start()

            actor = MagicMock() # replace with your actor

            changed_running_status = dispatcher.new_running_state_event_receiver("DISPATCH_TYPE")

            async for dispatch in changed_running_status:
                if dispatch.started:
                    print(f"Executing dispatch {dispatch.id}, due on {dispatch.start_time}")
                    if actor.is_running:
                        actor.reconfigure(
                            components=dispatch.target,
                            run_parameters=dispatch.payload, # custom actor parameters
                            dry_run=dispatch.dry_run,
                            until=dispatch.until,
                        )  # this will reconfigure the actor
                    else:
                        # this will start a new actor with the given components
                        # and run it for the duration of the dispatch
                        actor.start(
                            components=dispatch.target,
                            run_parameters=dispatch.payload, # custom actor parameters
                            dry_run=dispatch.dry_run,
                            until=dispatch.until,
                        )
                else:
                    actor.stop()  # this will stop the actor
        ```

    Example: Getting notification about dispatch lifecycle events
        ```python
        import os
        from typing import assert_never

        from frequenz.dispatch import Created, Deleted, Dispatcher, Updated

        async def run():
            url = os.getenv("DISPATCH_API_URL", "grpc://fz-0004.frequenz.io:50051")
            key  = os.getenv("DISPATCH_API_KEY", "some-key")

            microgrid_id = 1

            dispatcher = Dispatcher(
                microgrid_id=microgrid_id,
                server_url=url,
                key=key
            )
            await dispatcher.start()  # this will start the actor

            events_receiver = dispatcher.new_lifecycle_events_receiver("DISPATCH_TYPE")

            async for event in events_receiver:
                match event:
                    case Created(dispatch):
                        print(f"A dispatch was created: {dispatch}")
                    case Deleted(dispatch):
                        print(f"A dispatch was deleted: {dispatch}")
                    case Updated(dispatch):
                        print(f"A dispatch was updated: {dispatch}")
                    case _ as unhandled:
                        assert_never(unhandled)
        ```

    Example: Creating a new dispatch and then modifying it.
        Note that this uses the lower-level `Client` class to create and update the dispatch.

        ```python
        import os

        This receiver will receive a message whenever the current running

        Usually, one message per scheduled run is to be expected.
        However, things get complicated when a dispatch was modified:

        If it was currently running and the modification now says
        it should not be running or running with different parameters,
        then a message will be sent.

        In other words: Any change that is expected to make an actor start, stop
        or adjust itself according to new dispatch options causes a message to be
        sent.

         - The duration of the dispatch has been modified

         - The payload changed
         - The dispatch was deleted
